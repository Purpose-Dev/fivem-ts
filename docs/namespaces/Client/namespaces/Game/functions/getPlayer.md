# Function: getPlayer()

> **getPlayer**(): [`Player`](../../../classes/Player.md)

Retrieves the player instance, caching it if necessary.

The method checks if there is a cached player instance. If the cached
player is undefined or its owner does not match the current player ID,
it creates a new Player instance and caches it. Otherwise, it returns
the cached player.

## Returns

[`Player`](../../../classes/Player.md)

The current player instance.

## Defined in
